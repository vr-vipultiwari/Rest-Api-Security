Authentication is the process of letting an application know who we are. Typically, when we access any application, for example, banking application, the first step is to
log in by providing our user ID and password.
The banking application will validate that user id and password. This process is called authentication. If the authentication is successful, then we can access other pages in the application.
If not, we cannot.
